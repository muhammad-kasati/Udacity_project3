# Weather Journal App

This is a weather journal application that allows users to input their ZIP code and feelings to retrieve the current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and display it along with their entered feelings.

## Project Description

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The goal is to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's ZIP code input and combines it with the user's feelings to create a journal entry.
